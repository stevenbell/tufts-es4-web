# Final writeup
- [Guidelines for your project writeup](project/project_reports.pdf)

You should submit a single zip file containing your report and your project code.
Submit the zip file on `provide` as `project` (`provide es4 project YOURFILE.zip`).

If you've been using Git, you're welcome to just send me a link or add me to the repository instead of zipping everything up.

# General inspiration
- [Video showing many early arcade games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDBLokIOLcs)
- [Yoshi's nightmare - an FPGA-based video game](https://embeddedthoughts.com/2016/12/09/yoshis-nightmare-fpga-based-video-game/). This author does an excellent job explaining how FSMs, ROMs, VGA, etc. all work together to make a complete game.  Worth reading if your team is building an arcade game.
